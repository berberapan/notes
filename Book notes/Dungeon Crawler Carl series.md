## Thoughts after book 1 and book 2

Some references nicely done. Rory and Lorelai names for Goblins were a fun if you know you know, way more subtle than most others in the book. Another good way of doing it was talking about the size of a raptor and talking about the Jurassic Park without mentioning that series by name.

Reference done badly I've got a slew of examples but take this one for example. This is in my opinion very bad writing. Even if I would know what's being referenced it's nonsensical and lazy way of describing something.

```
Itâ€™s like taking Jason from a Friday the Thirteenth movie and tossing him into a late-season episode of Jane the Virgin just to see what happens.
```

Sometimes the author handle it too much like a video game. Describing stuff in a way that would be better in a visual sense than for a reader. And sometimes introducing a character but waiting with describing it and coming back later when you as a reader already painted your own picture.

Tempo of the book is in general good. Paced out well so far.

First boss fight in book 1 was my favourite so far with some curious things happen and darkness around it all.

The rules of the world the author come up with gives him a lot of leeway to jump around and change things without having to retcon but it still seems he's got a good idea where the storylines are going which I appreciate.
