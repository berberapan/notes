## Describe Cloud Concepts

### Domain 1.1 - Describe cloud computing

```
NIST SP 800-145 (Industry definition)
Cloud computing is a model for enabling universal, convenient on-demand network access
to  a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Microsoft definition
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
```

Cloud enables organisations to quickly expand their compute footprint without the need to build a datacenter.

Benefits of Cloud Computing - Cloud is **cost-effective**, **global**, **secure**, **scalable**, **elastic** and **always current**. Allows organisations to transfer risk, operational responsibility, and focus on innovation.

#### Public Cloud

Everything runs on the CSP's hardware. You don't need to build your own datacenter. Popular among start-ups.

Advantages:
- Scalability
- Agility
- Pay as you go
- No maintenance
- Low skills

#### Private Cloud

A cloud environment in your own datacenter. Used when customer needs more control. Might need to run an older version of Windows.

Advantages:
- Legacy support
- Control
- Compliance

#### Hybrid Cloud

Combines public and private clouds, allows customer to run apps in the right location. Gives flexibility in legacy, compliance and scalability scenarios.
Very common in large enterprise scenarios.

#### Economies of Scale

The ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when **operating at a larger scale**.

#### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

The spending of money on **physical infrastructure up front**. 
*Associated with legacy on-premises datacenter scenarios*.

#### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

Spending money on services or products now and being **billed as you go**.
*Associated with public cloud consumption (PAYG)*

The cloud increases OpEx spending and reduces CapEx spending.

#### Consumption-based model

**Pay for what you use**, typically per unit of time or capacity.

#### Fixed price model

You provision resources and pay for those instances **whether you use them or not**.
*Ensures predictable costs for your cloud services*.

#### Serverless Architecture

Cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the **allocation and provisioning of servers**. 

Hosted as *PAYG model* based on use.

Resources are **stateless**, servers **ephemeral** and often capable of being *triggered*.

Examples of serverless are **Azure Functions**, **Logic App** and **Event Grid**.

![[serverlessvspaas.png]]

#### Logic App

A cloud service that helps you schedule, automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes and **workflows**. You can choose from a gallery of hundreds of **pre-built connectors** for MSFT & 3rd party services.

*Logic App is the foundation for Power Automate (MS Flow)*

#### Azure Functions

An event driven, **compute-on-demand** experience that extends the existing Azure applications platform with capabilities to implement code *triggered by events* occurring in Azure as well as on-premises systems. Supports multiple programming languages. 

Because it's triggered it doesn't need to pull. *That enables billing per execution rather than by time*.

#### Event Grid

Enables you to easily **manage events** across many different Azure services and applications. Once a subscription is created, Event Grid will push events to the configured destination.

Event Grid will push an event from *Event Sources* e.g. Azure Machine Learning to *Event Handlers* like for example Azure Functions or Logic Apps. 

It's a *Pub/Sub model*, *app or service "reacting" to an event*.

Makes it easy for developers to utilise the "push" model instead of the inefficient "pull" across their serverless architecture. 

*Like Azure Functions, Event Grid is pay per use*.

### Domain 1.2 - Describe the benefits of using cloud services

#### Availability

Encompasses availability of the infrastructure, applications and services.
Generally expressed as a number of 9's, such as five nines or 99.999% availability.
Availability != uptime even though they often are used interchangeably.

#### Scalability 

The ability of a system to handle **growth** of users or work.

*Refers to ability of a system or service to handle more traffic (to scale)*

*Controlled by SKU or tier selection*.
#### Elasticity

The ability of a system to **automatically grow and shrink** based on *app demand*.

*Focuses on the ability of a system or service to scale quickly to spikes in demand*.

Capabilities can be *rapidly provisioned and de-provisioned* (scale-out, scale-int).
#### Agility

Focuses on the speed and ease of *allocating and deallocating resources*. Cloud is agile because you can press a button to allocating more resources versus on-premise where you need to buy hardware. This allows for vast amounts of computing resources to be provisioned in minutes.

#### Fault Tolerance

The ability of a system to handle faults in a service like **power**, **network** or **hardware failures**.

Generally refers to **component-level failures**.

#### High Availability

The ability to **keep services up and running** for long periods of time.

Generally refers to **service-level failures**.

#### Disaster Recovery

The **ability to recover** from an event which has taken down a cloud service.

Generally focuses on **recovery in the event of a service or site failure**.

#### Reliability

The ability of a system to recover from failures and continues to function.
Reliability consists of two principles: resiliency and availability.
Resiliency aims to *return an application to a fully functioning state* after a failure occurs. Availability is to provide *consistent access* to the application. 

#### Predictability

Azure enables solutions with predictable cost and performance.
*The level of service and performance and the associated cost are known in advance*.

#### Security

- Protection of customer data
- Protection of cloud applications
- Protection of cloud infrastructure

I.e. IaaS gives the customer more control versus PaaS and SasS, but places more security responsibility on the customer.

The **Shared Responsibility Model** explains who is responsible for security in each model and scenario.
#### Azure DDoS

All models have built-in DDoS protection with Azure DDoS.

Standard tier provides *enhanced DDoS mitigation* features to defend against DDoS attacks. Also includes logging, alerting and telemetry not included in the free Basic tier.

#### Governance 

A set of rules and policies that guide an organisation's cloud operations. To ensure data security, manage risk, control costs and improve efficiency.

*The guidance and guardrails that ensure we're as secure, consistent and efficient as possible*.

Cloud features are designed to support governance and compliance. Deployment templates help ensure deployed resources meet corporate *standards and regulatory requirements*.

#### Cloud Adoption Framework

Guidance designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies to succeed in Azure.

*Includes governance framework based on "Five disciplines of cloud governance.*

#### Manageability

- Of the cloud
	 **Automatically scale** resources deployment based on need. 
	 *Deploy resources* based on a preconfigured template.
	 **Monitor** the health of resources *and* automatically replace failing resources.
	 *Receive automatic alerts* based on configuration metrics.

- In the cloud
	 Speaks to *how you're able to manage* your cloud environment and resources:
	 - Through a web portal 
	 - Using a command line interface
	 - Using API's
	 - Using PowerShell


### Domain 1.3 - Describe cloud service types

![[sharedresponsibility.png]]

*Hybrid cloud includes IaaS (at minimum), connected by site-to-site VPN*.

#### IaaS

CSP provides building blocks, like networking, storage and compute.
CSP manages staff, HW and datacenter.

Common IaaS services: Azure Virtual Machines, Amazon EC2 and GCP Compute Engine.

When to use VM's? 
- **During testing and development**. Quick and easy way to create different environments. Test and dev teams can *easily deploy and then delete the VMs* when no longer needed.
- **When running applications in the cloud.** Tech and financial benefits as application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting down VMs when you don't need them or quickly start them up in case of higher demand means you only *pay for resources you use*.
- **When extending your datacenter to the cloud**. Extend capabilities of on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to the virtual network. *Makes it easier/less expensive to deploy than on-premises*.
- **During disaster recovery**. Enables cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. *Enables push button automated VM spin up and shutdown in a disaster*.

#### PaaS

Customer is responsible for deployment and management of apps.
CSP manages provisioning, configuration, hardware and OS.

There are a number of cloud services that fall under the PaaS category, a few examples are Azure SQL Database, API Management and Azure App Service.

When to use PaaS?
**Development framework**. PaaS **provides a framework** that developers can build upon to develop or customise cloud-based applications. PaaS lets devs *create applications using built-in software components*. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that devs must do.
*Reduces devs effort and increases solution quality*.
**Analytics or business intelligence**. Tools provided as a service with PaaS allows organisations to analyse and mine their data. *Improves* forecasting and other *business decisions*.
*Simplifies data analysis and improves business outcomes*.

#### SaaS

Customer just configures features.
CSP is responsible for management, operation and service availability.
*Customer has some responsibility in access management and data recovery*

Office 365 is an example of SaaS.

**Common SaaS use cases include**:
Email and messaging
Business productivity applications
Finance and expense tracking

*These are important utility functions not core to the company's purpose.*

## Describe Azure Architecture and Services

### Domain 2.1 - Describe the core architectural components

#### Azure Geography

A **discrete market**, typically containing two or more regions, that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

A **set of datacenters** deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

Includes *Azure Sovereign Regions*. Special regions that you might need to use for compliance or legal purpose. Examples Government (Fed govt, DoD), China. They are operated by special *trustees* and got *physical and logical isolation*.

Prices are not the same in all geographies and regions.

#### Region Pairs

A relationship between **two Azure Regions** within the same geographic region for disaster recovery purpose.

Region pairs is at least 300 miles apart. For example US East and US West.

![[hierachycomps.png]]

#### Management Groups

Management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. Each directory is given a single top-level management group called the "Root".

*A boundary for management and application of policy*,

For example you can apply a policy to a management group that limits the regions available for VM creation. This policy will be applied to all nested management groups, subscriptions and resources to allow VM creation only authorised regions.

Think policy based management.

#### Subscription 

Subscription is a logical container used to provision resources in Azure.

Why create multiple subscriptions?
- When **subscription limits** are reached.
- To use different **payment methods**.
- To **isolate resources** between departments, projects, etc.

#### Resource Groups

A container that holds **related resources** for an Azure solution.

Used to group resources that share a common **resource lifecycle**.

For a VM it might be things like the VM, Public IP address, Network Interface etc.

#### Resources

An **entity managed by Azure**, like a VM, virtual network or storage account.

#### Availability Zones

**Unique physical locations** *within a region* with independent power, network and cooling.

Comprised of *one or more* datacenters.

Tolerant to datacenter failures via redundancy and isolation. *Zone redundant*.

#### Azure Datacenters

Physical buildings that contain thousands of servers and other hardware to provide cloud computing services. Azure datacenters are located all over the world and are organised into regions. Designed to be secure, reliable and efficient, leveraging economies of scale, multi-tenant.

*Consists of multiple physical buildings, redundant power, ISPs etc*

### Domain 2.2 - Describe Azure compute and networking services

#### Azure VMs

Server virtualisation **(compute) on-demand** without need for hardware purchase.

VM Options:
- **Virtual machine *scale* sets**
	Allows you to create and manage a group of identical, **load-balanced VMs**.
	The number of VM instances can *automatically* **increase of decrease** in response to demand based on a schedule. *Focus = scale (scalability, capacity)*
- **Virtual machine *availability* sets**
	Help build a more resilient, highly available environment by **staggering VM updates** and ensuring *varied power and network connectivity*. *Focus = resiliency (availability)*
	Focus through two mechanisms: **Fault Domains and Update Domains.**

**Update Domains** - Allows you to apply updates while knowing that **only one update domain grouping** will be offline at a time.

**Fault Domains** - Groups your VMs by *common* **power source** and **network switch**. By default, an availability set will split your VMs across *up to three fault domains*.

#### Azure Virtual Desktop

A **desktop and app virtualisation** service that runs in Microsoft Azure.

Enable IT pros to create **Windows 10 & 11 virtual desktops** in Azure.

*VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)*

#### Azure Container Instance (ACI)

Runs **Docker containers on-demand** in a managed, serverless Azure environment.

A solution for any scenario that can operate in **isolated containers**, *without orchestration*. 

#### Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

A **hosted Kubernetes service**, where Azure handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for you. 

**You pay only for the agents nodes** within your clusters, not for the masters (free tier).

In *production*, for a financially backed SLA you pay a few cents per hour for cluster management.

#### VM Resource Requirements

Virtual Disk
Virtual Network (VNET)
Network Interface (Virtual NIC)
Network Security Group
Public IP Address

#### App Service

An HTTP-based service for **hosting web applications**, REST APIs, and mobile backends.

Types of app service styles include

- Web apps
	 Using ASP.NET, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python etc 
- API apps
	 REST-based web APIs by using your choice of language and framework.
	 Full Swagger support and publish to Azure Marketplace. 
- Web jobs
	  Run a **program** (.exe, Java, Python) or **script** (.cmd, .bat, Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app or mobile app. Can be scheduled or run by a trigger. Often used to run background tasks as part of your application logic.
- Mobile apps
	  Used to quickly build a backend for iOS and Android apps. Enables auth with social identity providers, send push notifications and execute backend logic.

#### Virtual Network (VNET)

A **logical representation** of your network in Azure. A VNET contains one or more SUBNETS.

VNET provide **logical isolation** in Azure dedicated to your subscription.

- Create a dedicated private **cloud-only network**
- Securely extend your datacenter (**Site-to-Site VPN**)
- Enables **hybrid cloud** scenarios

*VMs in different VNETs cannot communicate by default.*

#### Virtual Subnet

**Segment address space** of VNET to create sub-networks. Allows Azure **resource deployment** into a specific subnet. Can affect outbound access and routing traffic between resources.

*VMs in different subnets within a VNET can communicate by default.*

#### VPN Gateway

A **virtual network gateway** that sends encrypted traffic between an **Azure VNET** and an **on-premises location** over the internet.

*Core component of Hybrid Cloud*.

*Site-to-Site VPN traffic traverses the internet*.

#### VNET Peering

Enables seamless connection of **two or more VNETs** in Azure. The **two networks function as one** in terms of connectivity.

#### ExpressRoute

Extends your on-premises networks into Azure over a **private connection** with the help of a **connectivity provider**.

*Traffic does not traverse the internet.*

#### Azure DNS

A hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Azure infrastructure.

*Can provide both internal and external DNS*.

#### Public and private endpoints

**Service Endpoint**
Provides a way to lock down access to *all instances* of a PaaS service or VNET.
*Accessible from public internet*.

**Private Endpoint**
Grants access to **a specific instance** of a PaaS service in your VNET on a private IP address.
*Enables access from on-premises without public endpoint*.

#### Defense in-Depth 

A layered approach that does not rely on one method to completely protect your environment.

#### Network Security Group

Contains security rules that **allow or deny** *inbound* network traffic to or *outbound* network traffic from several types of Azure resources.

For each rule, you can specify **source** and **destination port** and **protocol**.

Can be applied to a **subnet** or **network adapter**.

Similar to a firewall.

#### Azure Firewall

A managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure VNET resources.

It's a **fully statefull firewall** *as a service* with built-in *high availability* and unrestricted cloud *scalability*.

#### Azure DDoS (repeat)

All models have built-in DDoS protection with Azure DDoS.

Standard tier provides *enhanced DDoS mitigation* features to defend against DDoS attacks. Also includes logging, alerting and telemetry not included in the free Basic tier.

### Domain 2.3 - Describe Azure storage services

#### Blob storage

Storage optimised for storing massive amounts of **unstructured data**.

*Unstructured data is data that cannot be stored in a row-column database and does not have an associated data model. E.g images, videos, social media posts.*

#### File storage

Fully managed **file shares** in Azure accessible via **SMB or NFS**.

#### Disk storage

Azure managed disks are **block-level storage volumes** that are managed by Azure and *used with Azure VMs*.

#### Table storage

A service that stores **structured NoSQL data** in Azure, including a schemaless key/attribute store.

#### Queue storage

A service for storing large numbers of **messages**, accessible from anywhere via authenticated **HTTP or HTTPS** calls.

#### Storage Tiers

Azure storage hot, cool, cold and archive access tiers to store blob object data in a cost-effective manner.

*Use lifecycle management policies to automate tiers*.

Archive is the least expensive, than it goes cold, cool and hot.
The reverse is true for access cost, hot will access the quickest.

**Archive** - *Lowest storage costs but highest access costs*. An offline tier optimised for storing data that is **rarely accessed** and has a flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours.
**Cold** - *Lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to cool*. An online tier optimised for storing data that is **rarely accessed** or modified but still requires fast retrieval.
**Cool** - *Lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to hot*. An online tier optimised for storing data that is **infrequently accessed** or modified.
**Hot** - *Highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs*. An online tier optimised for storing data that is accessed or modified **frequently**.

#### Storage Redundancy

Primary region only

**LRS** (Locally redundant storage) - Copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region.
**ZRS** (Zone redundant storage) - Copies your data synchronously across three Azure **availability zones** in the primary region.

Extended to secondary region

**GRS** (Geo-redundant storage) - Copies your data synchronously three times **within a single physical location** in the primary region using LRS. It then copies it asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. *Three copies using LRS*.
**GZRS** (Geo-zone redundant storage) - Copies your data synchronously three times **within the primary region** *using ZRS*. It then copies it asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region.

Microsoft recommends GZRS for apps requiring high availability.

#### AzCopy

*Customers are shipped a proprietary Data Box storage device*

### Domain 2.4 - Describe Azure identity, access and security

#### AuthN and AuthZ

**Authentication (AuthN)** is the process of proving that you are who you say you are. *Identity*

**Authorization (AuthZ)** is the act of granting an authenticated party permission to do something. *Access*

#### Entra ID

Entra is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service which helps your employees sign in and access resources, including: 
- Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network or custom cloud apps.
- External resources, such as Microsoft 365, Azure portal and many SaaS apps.

#### Single Sign-on (SSO)

Single sing-on means user doesn't have to sign into every application they use. The user logs in *once* and that credential is for *multiple* apps.

Single sign-on based authentication systems are often called "modern authentication".

#### MFA

MFA in Entra ID works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods:

- Something you know (pin or password)
- Something you have (trusted device)
- Something you are (biometric)

**Authenticator app** can be used as a **primary form of authentication** to sign into any Entra ID account. Can also be used as an *additional verification* option during self-service password reset (SSPR) or Entra ID MFA events.

**OATH token** is an open standard that specifies how **time-based, one-time password (TOTP)** codes are generated. The Microsoft Authenticator app generates OATH tokens.

**FIDO2** uses public-key (asymmetric) cryptography for user authentication. User has a physical device (USB or NFC).

**Windows Hello for Business** is an authentication feature built into Windows 10 and 11 which replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices.

Windows Hello for Business leverages key-based or certificate-based authentication.

The safest and best is *passwordless* options such Windows Hello, Authenticator App and FIDO2.

#### External Identities

**B2B collaboration** - Enables external users to **use their preferred identity** to sign into your Microsoft or other enterprise applications (SaaS apps, custom-developed apps etc.)
*Supports Entra ID and social identities*

**B2B direct connect** - Establish a *mutual two-way trust with another Entra ID organisation* for seamless collaboration. Useful for heavily, daily collaboration with **close business partners**
*Supports multiple two-way trusts*

**B2C** - Publish modern SaaS apps or custom-developed apps **to consumers and customers**, while using Entra ID B2C for identity and access management.
*Supports Entra & social identities*

**Entra ID multi-tenant organisations** - Collaborate with multiple tenants in a single Entra ID organisation via cross-tenant synchronization.
*Good for conglomerates mergers, multi-cloud, dept/test/staging tenants*

#### Conditional Access

Used by Entra ID to bring **signals** together, to make *decisions*, and enforce organisational **policies**.

Signals are stuff like the user, the user's location, are they coming from an managed device etc.

#### Azure RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

Azure RBAC helps you manage:

- **who** has access to Azure resources
- **what** they can do with those resources
- **which** resources/areas they have access to

Provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.
*One element of implementing "least privilege"*

#### Zero Trust

Zero Trust got three principles

**Verify explicitly**
*Always authenticate and authorize* based on all available data points

**Use least privilege access**
**Limit user access**  with JIT (Just-In-Time) and JEA (Just-Enough-Access), risk-based adaptive policies and data protection.

**Assume breach**
Segment access to *minimise blast radius*. Verify *end-to-end encryption* and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection and improve defenses.

In Zero Trust Architecture you must prove everything to get access.
*Trust must be earned and compliance must be proven*

**Identities** - should be verified with **strong authentication**. Users should be granted *least privilege access*.
**Devices** - should be monitored for **health and compliance** and updated when necessary.
**Apps** - only approved ones should be allowed to access company data and permissions managed.
**Data** - should be *classified, labeled and encrypted* based on its attributes, at rest and in motion.
**Infrastructure** - **version**, **configuration**, JIT **access** should be managed. Telemetry should be used to detect anomalous activity that may indicate attack.
**Network** - should be *segmented* to limit data access and **reduce threat exposure**. Real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring and analytics should be employed.

All this is layered defense (Defense in Depth).

#### Defender for Cloud

A unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your *cloud and on-premises datacenters.*

Provides security guidance for **compute, data, network, storage, app** and other services.

Includes support for both Azure and on-premises workloads, as well as other public clouds (AWS, GCP). *Multi-cloud support*.
