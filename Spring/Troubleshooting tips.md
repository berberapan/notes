It can be a bit difficult sometimes to find the problem when something isn't working in Spring. Below are five tips on what you should look at first.

1. Has the web server actually started? 
2. Has the deploy of the most recent version of the app been done?
3. Is the web server done with the deploy? (It can take some time)
4. Have you refreshed the browser? Cleared cache etc
5. Is the URL correct?
