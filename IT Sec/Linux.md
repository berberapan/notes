Linux follows five core principles:

| **Principle**                                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Everything is a file`                                        | All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.                                   |
| `Small, single-purpose programs`                              | Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.                                                              |
| `Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks` | The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results. |
| `Avoid captive user interfaces`                               | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.                                 |
| `Configuration data stored in a text file`                    | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                          |

The Linux operating system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy and is documented in the [Filesystem Hierarchy](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) Standard (FHS). Linux is structured with the following standard top-level directories:

| **Path** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`      | The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted, as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root. |
| `/bin`   | Contains essential command binaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `/boot`  | Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `/dev`   | Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `/etc`   | Local system configuration files.
