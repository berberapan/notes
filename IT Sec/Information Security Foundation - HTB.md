All programming languages follow the same three defined by R.D. Tennent
- The Principle of Abstraction
- The Principle of Correspondence
- The Principle of Data Type Completeness

We therefore don't need to know every language to read and understand the code. When working with Information Security you need to learn to understand the principles, structures and process quickly and adapt the knowledge to the different environments you encounter.

How you learn is also central. `20 * __ + __ = 65535`, this equation got several ways to be solved and most people will plug in the numbers to solve it. But where there any limitations given to you when given this? If not, why didn't you add more digits or replace the arithmetic operations. That what is called thinking outside the box when it comes to Info Sec.

When thinking outside the box you will encounter many options and the solution can get complicated very fast. The Occam's Razor is therefore a good tool to use.

`The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

For example if you're PC shuts down, you might start having a look at the different parts that handles the power, like the power supply. Occam's Razor after all would suggest that the problem is with the power but this is also overlooking the simplicity factor. Before taking your PC apart the question should be why is the PC not getting power? You shouldn't limit yourself to just the computer but thinking outside the box might get you to check if a fuse has blown using Occam's Razor to the same problem. Thinking outside the box is seeing things outside of the limitations placed on us. 

`A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.`

Frustration and confusion comes with point of view we are looking at. So the emotional state is important, if we feel good and confident that we'll reach our goal we will be successful. Also, know your goal. If you know what you want to achieve you will have an easier time overcoming obstacles and have an easier time focusing. A meta-analysis study with more than 40 000 participants showed that over 90% of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting challenging and specific goals. 

When learning keep the learning pyramid in mind and try to apply certain thing to retain the knowledge

| Retention rate | Activity                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 90%            | Teach someone else / use immediately |
| 75%            | Practice what one learned            |
| 50%            | Engage in a group discussion         |
| 30%            | Watch a demonstration                |
| 20%            | Watch audiovisual                    |
| 10%            | Read                                 |
| 5%             | Listen to a lecture                  |

And never let fear or failure stop you. Failure is essential to learning and it's also unavoidable.

`The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser.`

The art of asking the correct question is also very important in this and other fields. Many people believe that searching for the answer is one of the most difficult activities but it's more challenging to ask the correct question when we don't understand a concept or have any prior knowledge in an area.

`The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.`

A question isn't good or bad and shouldn't be assigned a value like that. Rather look at questions as rough or precise.

- A `rough question` would be, for example, "How can I hack X?"
- A `precise question` would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"

|**Component**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Your Position`|This describes the position we are in and our view.|
|`The Object`|The object is the core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes the meaning out of the question.|
|`Known`|This information is known to us.|
|`Unknown`|This information is not known to us.|
|`Other Position(s)`|This component describes the position of other persons.|
- `Solid line`: Connection - How is X connected to Y?
- `Dashed line`: Affection - How does Y influence the state of component X?

You can use this model to get better at asking the correct question.
